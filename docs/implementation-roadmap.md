# Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps for evolving the "CodeX New Generation" platform from documentation into a fully functional environment covering the entire software lifecycle.

## 1. Repository Structure & Tooling
The goal of this milestone is to create a solid foundation that keeps the
codebase organised and enforces quality standards from day one.

### Monorepo layout
- Create `apps/frontend`, `apps/backend`, and `packages/shared` directories to
  host application code and cross-cutting libraries.
- Configure workspace tooling so packages can be developed and versioned
  together.

### Package managers
- Initialise `package.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to manage JavaScript and
  TypeScript dependencies across the repository.
- Define a Python environment for the backend using `pyproject.toml` and
  virtual environments.

### Code quality tooling
- Add ESLint and Prettier for frontend linting and formatting.
- Configure Black and Flake8 for the Python backend.
- Set up `pre-commit` hooks to run linters and formatters before commits.

### Continuous integration
- Introduce a GitHub Actions workflow that installs dependencies, runs tests,
  and executes static analysis for all packages on every pull request.

## 2. Design System & UX
- Expand the design system with reusable components and style guidelines.
- Build Figma component library mirroring the implementation.
- Document accessibility requirements and theming strategy.

## 3. Frontend Application
- Scaffold a React-based web app consuming the design system.
- Integrate authentication flows and basic navigation.
- Implement core user flows for "Plan", "Build", and "Test" stages.

## 4. Backend Services
- Initialize Python FastAPI service for REST APIs.
- Define database schema and migrations.
- Implement endpoints for project management and user accounts.
- Add unit tests and integration tests.

## 5. AI & Automation Features
- Integrate OpenAI APIs for code generation and review.
- Build task automation framework for test execution and deployment.
- Expose AI-assisted features through both backend APIs and frontend UI.

## 6. Deployment & Operations
- Containerize services with Docker and define orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Set up staging and production environments.
- Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting.

## 7. Documentation & Developer Experience
- Maintain updated docs on setup, contribution guidelines, and architecture.
- Provide code examples and tutorial videos.
- Establish community support channels.

## 8. Release Management
- Adopt semantic versioning and changelog generation.
- Automate release pipelines with CI/CD.
- Gather user feedback and iterate regularly.

This document will evolve as the project grows and tasks are completed.
