# Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps for evolving the "CodeX New Generation" platform from documentation into a fully functional environment covering the entire software lifecycle.

## 1. Repository Structure & Tooling
- Establish monorepo layout for frontend, backend, and shared modules.
- Configure package managers (npm/pnpm for frontend, Python tooling for backend).
- Set up linting, formatting, and commit hooks.
- Introduce CI pipeline to run tests and static analysis on every pull request.

## 2. Design System & UX
- Expand the design system with reusable components and style guidelines.
- Build Figma component library mirroring the implementation.
- Document accessibility requirements and theming strategy.

## 3. Frontend Application
- Scaffold a React-based web app consuming the design system.
- Integrate authentication flows and basic navigation.
- Implement core user flows for "Plan", "Build", and "Test" stages.

## 4. Backend Services
- Initialize Python FastAPI service for REST APIs.
- Define database schema and migrations.
- Implement endpoints for project management and user accounts.
- Add unit tests and integration tests.

## 5. AI & Automation Features
- Integrate OpenAI APIs for code generation and review.
- Build task automation framework for test execution and deployment.
- Expose AI-assisted features through both backend APIs and frontend UI.

## 6. Deployment & Operations
- Containerize services with Docker and define orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Set up staging and production environments.
- Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting.

## 7. Documentation & Developer Experience
- Maintain updated docs on setup, contribution guidelines, and architecture.
- Provide code examples and tutorial videos.
- Establish community support channels.

## 8. Release Management
- Adopt semantic versioning and changelog generation.
- Automate release pipelines with CI/CD.
- Gather user feedback and iterate regularly.

This document will evolve as the project grows and tasks are completed.
