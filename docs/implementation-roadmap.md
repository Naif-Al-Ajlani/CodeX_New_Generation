# Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps for evolving the "CodeX New Generation" platform from documentation into a fully functional environment covering the entire software lifecycle.

## 1. Repository Structure & Tooling

### Monorepo Layout
1. Create `apps/frontend` for the web interface and `apps/backend` for API services.
2. Add `packages/shared` for utilities and types consumed by both layers.
3. Use a single root `README` and `LICENSE` to govern all modules.

### Package Management
1. Configure a root `package.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to manage frontend packages with `pnpm`.
2. Introduce `pyproject.toml` using Poetry or PDM to handle backend dependencies.
3. Document commands for installing dependencies in each workspace.

### Linting, Formatting, and Commit Hooks
1. Add ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript code.
2. Add Black and Ruff (or Flake8) for Python formatting and linting.
3. Create a `.editorconfig` to enforce consistent editor settings.
4. Wire up Husky or `pre-commit` hooks so linting and formatting run before commits.

### Continuous Integration
1. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pytest`.
2. Include static type checks like `tsc` for TypeScript and `mypy` for Python.
3. Require the workflow to pass on every pull request before merging.

## 2. Design System & UX
- Expand the design system with reusable components and style guidelines.
- Build Figma component library mirroring the implementation.
- Document accessibility requirements and theming strategy.

## 3. Frontend Application
- Scaffold a React-based web app consuming the design system.
- Integrate authentication flows and basic navigation.
- Implement core user flows for "Plan", "Build", and "Test" stages.

## 4. Backend Services
- Initialize Python FastAPI service for REST APIs.
- Define database schema and migrations.
- Implement endpoints for project management and user accounts.
- Add unit tests and integration tests.

## 5. AI & Automation Features
- Integrate OpenAI APIs for code generation and review.
- Build task automation framework for test execution and deployment.
- Expose AI-assisted features through both backend APIs and frontend UI.

## 6. Deployment & Operations
- Containerize services with Docker and define orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Set up staging and production environments.
- Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting.

## 7. Documentation & Developer Experience
- Maintain updated docs on setup, contribution guidelines, and architecture.
- Provide code examples and tutorial videos.
- Establish community support channels.

## 8. Release Management
- Adopt semantic versioning and changelog generation.
- Automate release pipelines with CI/CD.
- Gather user feedback and iterate regularly.

This document will evolve as the project grows and tasks are completed.
