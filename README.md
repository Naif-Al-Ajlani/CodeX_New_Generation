# CodeX New Generation

This repository hosts documentation and scaffolding for the "Lovable, Figma, & Replit" enterprise AI development platform. The project aims to deliver an end‑to‑end environment that spans the software lifecycle from **Plan → Build → Test → Ship → Operate**.

The `/docs` folder contains design system specifications and user‑flow guidelines. Future iterations will include frontend, backend, and deployment scaffolding.
